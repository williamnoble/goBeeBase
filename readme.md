# GoBeeBase - a tutorial re-wrte

I found a tutorial
https://medium.com/@adigunhammedolalekan/build-and-deploy-a-secure-rest-api-with-go-postgresql-jwt-and-gorm-6fadf3da505b

It's easy to get stuck in tutorial hell. My preference for a tutorial is simply re-write it in my own style! Therefore I
have composed my own version of this tutorial from the ground up. I hope it helps beginner Go developers with securing a
restAPI.
